                        <h4><mark>CPR: A Real Lifesaver</mark></h4>
                        <strong>What Is CPR?</strong>CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is a way to help a person who
                        has stopped breathing, and whose heart may have stopped beating, to stay alive. "Cardio" is
                        about the heart and "pulmonary" is about the lungs. "Resuscitation" means "revive." <br>
                        <strong>What Happens During CPR?</strong>
                        The person giving CPR — called a rescuer — follows three main steps, which are known as C-A-B:
                        <ol>
                            <li>C: Do chest compressions.</li>
                            <li>A: Check the airway.</li>
                            <li>B: Do rescue breathing.</li>
                        </ol> <br>
                        <strong>What Are Chest Compressions?</strong>
                        The rescuer presses on the person's chest many times in a row to move blood out of the heart
                        that has stopped beating. <br>
                        <strong>What Is Checking the Airway?</strong>
                        The rescuer, after doing 30 chest compressions, checks the airway by listening and looking to
                        see if the person is breathing. <br>
                        <strong>What Is Rescue Breathing?</strong>
                        Rescue breathing helps to move oxygen, which everyone needs to live, down into the lungs of the
                        person who isn't breathing. If the person is not breathing, TWO rescue breaths are given. <br>
                        <strong>When Should Someone Use CPR?</strong>
                        The steps in CPR (compressions, airway, and breathing) should be used whenever someone is not
                        breathing and when their heart is not beating. <br>
                        <h4><mark>Nosebleeds</mark></h4>
                        Most nosebleeds look worse than they are. In other words, nosebleeds are messy, a little
                        uncomfortable, and sometimes even scary, but they're usually no big deal.

                        A kid might get nosebleeds just once in a while or more often. The nosebleeds that are most
                        common in kids usually happen near the front of the nose, on the wall separating the two sides
                        of the nose (the septum), and usually start from just one nostril.

                        Sometimes nosebleeds start farther back in the nose, but this is rare and mostly happens in
                        older people or those who have high blood pressure or injuries to their nose or face. <br>
                        <strong>If You Get a Nosebleed</strong>
                        You know that you should see a doctor if your nosebleed was caused by an injury, such as a
                        punch. But what if it just starts bleeding on its own?

                        Follow these steps:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't lie down. Sit up or stand.</li>
                            <li>Use tissues or a damp washcloth to catch the blood.</li>
                            <li>Tip your head forward. <strong>Don't</strong> lean your head back; this can make blood
                                run down your throat.</li>
                            <li>Pinch the soft part of your nose together (just below the bony part of your nose) and
                                breathe through your mouth. Do this for 10 minutes. Make sure you hold the pressure for
                                10 minutes without stopping. It seems like a long time when you actually do it, so
                                having someone check the time may help.</li>
                            <li>if your nosebleed doesn't stop after 10 minutes of pressure, pinch it for another 10
                                minutes. If it still hasn't stopped, your mom, dad, or another adult should talk to a
                                doctor.</li>
                            <li>Do not pick, rub, or blow your nose — this can make your nose bleed more.</li>

                        <strong>When Should I See a Doctor?</strong>
                        Your parent should call the doctor or take you to the emergency department if :
                        <ul>
                            <li>You feel dizzy, weak, or faint (like you might pass out).</li>
                            <li>Your nose is bleeding fast or you seem to be losing a lot of blood.</li>
                            <li>You just started taking a new medicine.</li>
                            <li>You have other symptoms, such as unusual bruising on your body.</li>
                            <li>You are bleeding for a long time after you get hurt.</li>
                            <li>You are bleeding from other areas of your body, such as your gums.</li>
                        </ul>
